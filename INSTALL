============================= alfy INSTALLATION README =====================

1) Extracting the tarfile:

"tar -xvzf gmos_xxx.tgz"

2) switch to Gmos_XXX:

"cd Gmos_XXX"

3) Generate program

"make"

This command builds the libraries and two executables: "gmos" and "gmos64".
"gmos" is a 32-bit program and "gmos64" is a 64-bit program. 
"gmos64" should be only used for large-scale data sets containing more than 5 x 10^8 bp, 
and "gmos" from smaller data sets.

5) If you would like to use "gmos" or "gmos" from any directory without referring to
"Gmos_XXX/gmos", simply include the path to these executables in you PATH variable, e.g:

PATH=${PATH}:$(HOME)/some-path/Gmos_XXX

or copy the executables to your bin directory.
